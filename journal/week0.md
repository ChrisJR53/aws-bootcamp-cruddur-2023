### Budget
A budget was created with varying thresholds in order to warm me if my likely spend would exceed 15 USD for a given month (Exceeded here due to my one-off 13 USD spend on domain):

## Homework Challenges
### Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role
A random password was created using LastPass, which was set for the root account and then not recorded anywhere:
