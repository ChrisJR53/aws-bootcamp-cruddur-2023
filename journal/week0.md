### Budget
A budget was created with varying thresholds in order to warm me if my likely spend would exceed 15 USD for a given month (Exceeded here due to my one-off 13 USD spend on domain):

## Homework Challenges
### Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role
A random password was created using LastPass, which was set for the root account and then not recorded anywhere (Password generated below is only an example):

![random_password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123467130/221187387-fd255f4f-c37e-4d9e-86fa-6b3f55d1e7a8.PNG)

[Password Generator Link](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator#generatorTool)

The Google Authenticator app was used to add MFA to the admin account (root account previously had MFA):

An IAM role allowing an EC2 instance to assume full access to S3 buckets was then created:

### Use EventBridge to hook up Health Dashboard to SNS
