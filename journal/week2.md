### Instrument Honeycomb with OTEL
Firstly, I added the OTEL details into my ```docker-compose.yml``` file:

I then added the dependencies for OTEL into the ```requirements.txt``` file in the backend flask app and installed them with ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```:

Honeycomb tracing details were added to the ```app.py``` file on the flask app, as was a simple span processor to output local log details:

Once that was all impemented, I used ```$ docker compose up``` to get the application running and generate some traces, which came through to my Honeycomb dashboard:

I added the implementation of spans to the application code and managed to view them on Honeycomb as well:

I then tested out the Query function in Honeycomb to visualize ```COUNT``` and group by ```trace.trace_id```:

Within a span I used the Fields search to confirm the ```app.now``` and ```app.result_length``` were successfully reporting from the app:

I then searched using the visualize ```HEATMAP(duration_ms)``` to provide a heatmap illustaration of the differences in time of each trace and ```P90(duration_ms)``` to view the length of traces in the 90th percentile:

(Apologies for lightmode here, the heatmap dots wouldn't show otherwise!)
